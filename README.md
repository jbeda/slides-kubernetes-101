# k8s-intro

This is a slide deck for giving a introduction presentation for [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io).  It is released with the hope that others will use and adapt it to spread the good word.

This presentation should take 30-45 minutes to work through depending on how much elaboration you take when presenting the material.

I'm happy to take pull requests with changes to the content but reserve the right to reject them if they include details or takes on things that don't reflect my own opinions.  However, feel free to fork and modify as appropriate.  I'll always take PRs that add to this README to pointers to derived versions.

The diagrams have been created using Adobe Illustrator.  I know that not everyone has access to this program and so I apologize for that.  I tried to make it work with graphviz and failed.  I ran out of time to figure out anything else.
